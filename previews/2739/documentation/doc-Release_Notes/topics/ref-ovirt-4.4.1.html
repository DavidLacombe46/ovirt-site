<p>Previously, if you requested multiple concurrent network changes on a host, some requests were not handled due to a 'reject on busy' service policy. The current release fixes this issue with a new service policy: If resources are not available on the server to handle a request, the host queues the request for a configurable period. If server resources become available within this period, the server handles the request. Otherwise, it rejects the request. There is no guarantee for the order in which queued requests are handled.</p>

<p>When a virtual machine is loading, the Manager machine sends the domain XML with a NUMA Configuration CPU list containing the current CPU IDs. As a result, the libvirt/QEMU issued a warning that the NUMA Configuration CPU list is incomplete, and should contain IDs for all of the virtual CPUs.
In this release, the warning no longer appears in the log.</p>

<p>Previously, using <code>ovirt-engine-rename</code> did not handle the OVN provider correctly. This caused bad IP address and hostname configurations, which prevented adding new hosts and other related issues. The current release fixes this issue. Now, <code>ovirt-engine-rename</code> handles <code>ovirt-provider-ovn</code> correctly, resolving the previous issues.</p>

<p>When deploying the self-hosted engine on a host, the Broker and Agent Services are brought down momentarily. When the VDSM service attempted to send a get_stats message before the services are restarted, the communication failed and the VDSM logged an error message.
In this release, such events now result in a warning, and are not flagged or logged as errors.</p>

<p>Previously, commands trying to access an unresponsive NFS storage domain remained blocked for 20-30 minutes, which had significant impacts. This was caused by the non-optimal values of the NFS storage timeout and retry parameters. The current release fixes this issue: It changes these parameter values so commands to a non-responsive NFS storage domain fail within one minute.</p>

<p>Previously, importing a virtual machine (VM) from a snapshot that included the memory disk failed if you imported it to a storage domain that is different from the storage domain where the snapshot was created. This happened because the memory disk depended on the storage domain remaining unchanged. The current release fixes this issue. Registration of the VM with its memory disks succeeds. If the memory disk is not in the RHV Manager database, the VM creates a new one.</p>

<p>Previously, a custom scheduler policy was used without the <code>HostDevice</code> filter. Consequently, the virtual machine was scheduled on an unsupported host, causing a null pointer exception.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this update, some filter policy units are now mandatory, including <code>HostDevice</code>. These filter policy units are always active, cannot be disabled, and they are no longer visible in the UI or API.</p>

<p>Previously, if you lowered the cluster compatibility version, the change did not propagate to the self-hosted engine virtual machine. As a result, the self-hosted engine virtual machine was not compatible with the new cluster version; you could not start or migrate it to another host in the cluster. The current release fixes this issue: The lower cluster compatibility version propagates to the self-hosted engine virtual machine; you can start and migrate it.</p>

<p>Previously, if two or more templates had the same name, selecting any of these templates displayed the same details from only one of the templates. This happened because the Administration Portal identified the selected template using a non-unique template name. The current release fixes this issue by using the template ID, which is unique, instead.</p>

<p>Previously, the VM Portal was inconsistent in how it displayed pool cards. After a user took all of the virtual machines from them, the VM Portal removed automatic pool cards but continued displaying manual pool cards.
The current release fixes this issue: VM Portal always displays a pool card, and the card has a new label that shows how many virtual machines the user can take from the pool.</p>

<p>When a system had many FC LUNs with many paths per LUN, and a high I/O load, scanning of FC devices became slow, causing timeouts in monitoring VM disk size, and making VMs non-responsive.
In this release, FC scans have been optimized for speed, and VMs are much less likely to become non-responsive.</p>

<p>Previously, if you decided to redeploy RHV Manager as a hosted engine, running the <code>ovirt-hosted-engine-cleanup</code> command did not clean up the <code>/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf</code> file correctly. Then, the hosted engine redeployment failed to restart the libvirtd service because <code>libvirtd-tls.socket</code> remained active. The current release fixes this issue. You can run the cleanup tool and redeploy the Manager as a hosted engine.</p>

<p>Previously, mixing the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) activation and deactivation commands with other commands caused possible undefined LVM behavior and warnings in the logs. The current release fixes this issue. It runs the LVM activation and deactivation commands separately from other commands. This produces resulting well-defined LVM behavior and clear errors in case of failure.</p>

<p>Previously, if a host failed and if the RHV Manager tried to start the high-availability virtual machine (HA VM) before the NFS lease expired, OFD locking caused the HA VM to fail with the error, "Failed to get "write" lock Is another process using the image?."  If the HA VM failed three times in a row, the Manager could not start it again, breaking the HA functionality.
The current release fixes this issue. RHV Manager would continue to try starting the VM even after three failures (the frequency of the attempts decreases over time). Eventually, once the lock expires, the VM would be started.</p>

<p>Previously, after increasing the cluster compatibility version of a cluster with virtual machines that had outstanding configuration changes, those changes were reverted. The current release fixes this issue. It applies both the outstanding configuration changes and the new cluster compatibility version to the virtual machines.</p>

<p>Previously the <code>/</code> filesystem automatically grew to fit the whole disk, and the user could not increase the size of <code>/var</code> or <code>/var/log</code>.  This happened because, if a customer specified a disk larger than 49 GB while installing the Hosted Engine, the whole logical volume was allocated to the root (<code>/</code>) filesystem. In contrast, for the RHVM machine, the critical filesystems are <code>/var</code> and <code>/var/log</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The current release fixes this issue. Now, the RHV Manager appliance is  based on the logical volume manager (LVM). At setup time, its PV and VG are automatically extended, but the logical volumes (LVs) are not. As a result, after installation is complete, you can extend all of the LVs in the Manager VM using the free space in the VG.</p>

<p>Previously, an imported VM always had 'Cloud-Init/Sysprep' turned on. The Manager created a VmInit even when one did not exist in the OVF file of the OVA. The current release fixes this issue: The imported VM only has 'Cloud-Init/Sysprep' turned on if the OVA had it enabled. Otherwise, it is disabled.</p>

<p>Previously, changing the template version of a VM pool created from a delete-protected VM made the VM pool non-editable and unusable.

<p>Previously, after upgrading RHV 4.1 to a later version, high-availability virtual machines (HA VMs) failed validation and did not run. To run the VMs, the user had to reset the lease Storage Domain ID. The current release fixes this issue: It removes the validation and regenerates the lease information data when the lease Storage Domain ID is set. After upgrading RHV 4.1, HA VMs with lease Storage Domain IDs run.</p>

<p>When you use the engine ("Master") to set the high-availability host running the engine virtual machine (VM) to maintenance mode, the ovirt-ha-agent migrates the engine VM to another host. Previously, in specific cases, such as when these VMs had an old compatibility version, this type of migration failed. The current release fixes this problem.</p>

<p>Before this update, you could import a virtual machine from a cluster with a compatibility version lower than the target cluster, and the virtual machine&#8217;s cluster version would not automatically update to the new cluster&#8217;s compatibility version, causing the virtual machine&#8217;s configuration to be invalid. Consequently, you could not run the virtual machine without manually changing its configuration. With this update, the virtual machine&#8217;s cluster version automatically updates to the new cluster&#8217;s compatibility version. You can import virtual machines from cluster compatibility version 3.6 or newer.</p>

Now, when the hook starts, it checks if the OVS service is available, and bails out of the hook when the service is not available, so the log is no longer flooded with these error messages.</p>

<p>Previously, if ovirt-ha-broker restarted while the RHV Manager (engine) was querying the status of the self-hosted engine cluster, the query could get stuck. If that happened, the most straightforward workaround was to restart the RHV Manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This happened because the RHV Manager periodically checked the status of the self-hosted engine cluster by querying the VDSM daemon on the cluster host. With each query, VDSM checked the status of the ovirt-ha-broker daemon over a Unix Domain Socket. The communication between VDSM and ovirt-ha-broker wasn&#8217;t enforcing a timeout. If ovirt-ha-broker was restarting, such as trying to recover from a storage issue, the VDSM request could get lost, causing VDSM and the RHV Manager to wait indefinitely.</p>

As a result, the Graphical Console for the Hosted-Engine virtual machine is changeable.</p>

<p>Previously, in an IPv4-only host with a .local FQDN, the deployment kept looping searching for an available IPv6 prefix until it failed. This was because the hosted-engine setup picked a link-local IP address for the host. The hosted-engine setup could not ensure that the Engine and the host are on the same subnet when one of them used a link-local address. The Engine must not use on a link-local address to be reachable through a routed network. The current release fixes this issue: Even if the hostname is resolved to a link-local IP address, the hosted-engine setup ignores the link-local IP addresses and tries to use another IP address as the address for the host. The hosted-engine can deploy on hosts, even if the hostname is resolved to a link-local address.</p>

<p>With this enhancement, oVirt uses NetworkManager and NetworkManager Stateful Configuration (nmstate) to configure host networking. The previous implementation used network-scripts, which are deprecated in CentOS 8. This usage of NetworkManager helps to share code with software components. As a result, oVirt integrates better with RHEL-based software. Now, for example, the Cockpit web interface can see the host networking configuration, and oVirt can read the network configuration created by the Anaconda installer.</p>

<p>To transfer virtual machines between data centers, you use data storage domains because export domains were deprecated. However, moving a data storage domain to a data center that has a higher compatibility level (DC level) can upgrade its storage format version, for example, from V3 to V5. This higher format version can prevent you from reattaching the data storage domain to the original data center and transferring additional virtual machines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the current release,  if you encounter this situation, the Administration Portal asks you to confirm that you want to update the storage domain format, for example, from 'V3' to 'V5'. It also warns that you will not be able to attach it back to an older data center with a lower DC level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To work around this issue, you can create a destination data center that has the same compatibility level as the source data center. When you finish transferring the virtual machines, you can increase the DC level.</p>

The Data Warehouse is installed by default at Basic scale resource use. To obtain the full benefits of Grafana, it is recommended to update the Data Warehouse scale to Full (to be able to view a larger data collection interval of up to 5 years).
Full scaling may require migrating the Data Warehouse to a separate virtual machine.
For Data Warehouse scaling instructions, see <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.4/html-single/data_warehouse_guide/index#Changing_the_Data_Warehouse_Sampling_Scale" class="bare">https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.4/html-single/data_warehouse_guide/index#Changing_the_Data_Warehouse_Sampling_Scale</a>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is currently a known issue: Open vSwitch (OVS) does not work with nmstate-managed hosts. Therefore, OVS clusters cannot contain RHEL 8 hosts. Workaround: In clusters that use OVS, do not upgrade hosts to RHEL 8.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>BZ#<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1810550">1810550</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The current release contains a known issue: When the RHV Manager tries to change the mode of an existing bond to mode balance-tlb 5 or mode balance-alb 6, the host fails to apply this change. The Manager reports this as a user-visible error.
To work around this issue, remove the bond and create a new one with the desired mode. A solution is presently being worked on and, if successful, is intended for RHEL 8.2.1.</p>

<p>Known issue: If you configure a virtual machine&#8217;s BIOS Type and Emulation Machine Type with mismatched settings, the virtual machine fails when you restart it.
Workaround: To avoid problems, configure the BIOS Type and Emulation Machine Type with the proper settings for your hardware. The current release helps you avoid this issue: Adding a Host to a new cluster with auto-detect sets the BIOS Type accordingly.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Known issue: Unsubscribed RHVH hosts do not get package updates when you perform a 'Check for upgrade' operation. Instead, you get a 'no updates found' message. This happens because RHVH hosts that are not registered to Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) do not have repos enabled. Workaround: To get updates, register the RHVH host with Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM).</p>

<p>The current release contains a known issue: If a VM has a bond mode 1 (active-backup) over an SR-IOV vNIC and VirtIO vNIC, the bond might stop working after the VM migrates to a host with SR-IOV on a NIC that uses an i40e driver, such as the Intel X710.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To work around this problem, you can either:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use a different user account that does not belong to multiple organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Activation Key</strong> authentication method available in the Connect to Red Hat feature for GUI and Kickstart installations.</p>

<p>If you create VLANs on virtual functions of SR-IOV NICs, and the VLAN interface names are longer than ten characters, the VLANs fail. This happens because the naming convention for VLAN interfaces, <code>parent_device.VLAN_ID</code>, tends to produce names that exceed the 10-character limit. The workaround for this issue is to create udev rules as described in <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1854851" class="bare">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1854851</a>.</p>

<p>In RHEL 8.2, <code>ignoredisk --drives</code> is not recognized by Anaconda in Kickstart files correctly. Consequently, when installing or reinstalling the host’s operating system, it is strongly recommended that you either detach any existing non-OS storage that is attached to the host, or use <code>ignoredisk --only-use</code> to avoid accidental initialization of these disks, and with that, potential data loss.</p>
