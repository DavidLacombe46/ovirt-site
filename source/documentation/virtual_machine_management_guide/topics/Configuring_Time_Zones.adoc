[[Configuring_timezones]]
= Configuring the time zone

{virt-product-fullname} stores time zone configurations for virtual machines in */etc/ovirt-engine/conf/00-timezone.properties*. This file contains default time zone values such as `Etc/GMT=Greenwich Standard Time`. It features mappings that are valid for windows and non-Windows time zones.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not edit the actual *00-timezone.properties* file. Changes will be overwritten if you upgrade or restore the {engine-name}.

Do not change values that come directly from the operating system or the {engine-name}.
====

To change the time zone configuration, create an override file in */etc/ovirt-engine/conf/*. The file name must begin with a value greater than `00`, so that the file appears after */etc/ovirt-engine/conf/00-timezone.properties*, and ends with the extension, *.properties*.

For example, *10-timezone.properties* overrides the default file, *00-timezone.properties*. The last file in the file list has precedence over earlier files.

Once you have created a time zone configuration file, new time zones can be added to that file. When adding new time zones, be sure the key is a valid General timezone from the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database[tz database] and the value is a valid Windows timezone:

General:: Time zones used for non-Windows OS types, must follow the standard tz format for example, `Etc/GMT` or `Asia/Jerusalem`.
Windows:: Time zones specifically supported on link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ms912391(v=winembedded.11)?redirectedfrom=MSDN[Windows] for example, `GMT Standard Time` or `Israel Standard Time`.
