[[Configuring_timezones]]
= Configuring the time zone

{virt-product-fullname} stores time zone configurations for virtual machines in */etc/ovirt-engine/conf/00-timezone.properties*. This file contains default time zone values such as `Etc/GMT=Greenwich Standard Time`. It features mappings that are valid for windows and non-Windows time zones. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not edit the actual *00-timezone.properties* file. Changes will be overwritten if you upgrade or restore the {engine-name}.

Do not change values that come directly from the operating system or the {engine-name}.
====

To change the time zone configuration, create an override file in */etc/ovirt-engine/conf/*. The file name must begin with a value greater than `00`, so that the file appears after */etc/ovirt-engine/conf/00-timezone.properties*, and ends with the extension, *.properties*.

For example, *10-timezone.properties* overrides the default file, *00-timezone.properties*. The last file in the file list has precedence over earlier files.

Once you have created a time zone configuration file, new time zones can be added to that file. When adding new time zones, be sure the values you enter are valid Windows time zones.
